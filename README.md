# ToDoList-v1

I created a to do list using JavaScript, EJS, HTML, CSS and Node.js. 

I created a website that host my to do list live using heroku and mongodb. The link to the website is https://peaceful-dusk-23496.herokuapp.com/ 

# How to Use

Type to do item and press + button to add to list. Tick the checkbox if an item is completed. You can also create custom lists as well.
